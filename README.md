# 👋 Hey, I'm Naveed

### 💻 DevOps & SRE Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure | Automation Enthusiast

I’m a DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer with 6+ years of experience building scalable cloud platforms, automating infrastructure, and making systems resilient, observable, and cost-effective.

Currently focused on simplifying complex infrastructure with Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS — and enabling developers with reliable CI/CD pipelines.

## 🔧 Core Skills

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EKS, ECS, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, EMR)
- **Containers & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Loki
- **Languages**: Bash, Python, Go (basics)
- **Messaging & Data**: Kafka, SQS, RDS, Apache Spark
